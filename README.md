This is quite simply a collection of all of my random non-professional projects I've tried out. 
Some are because they were requested by me from friends, others are to satisfy my own curiosity, and 
  others were simply because I wanted to learn how to do a certain thing. 
  
Be warned, the comments are quite unprofessional. If the comments are professional, the project will be marked as such. 

Peace
